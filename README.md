# pokemon-data-scripts

Uses Python 3.x

CSV files are input, trainers.txt and encounters.txt are output
For the encounters, the two dat files are for linking Map Ids to Map names and for setting encounter frequency for each terrain tag.

Cells that are lists (e.g. Pokemon IVs and trainer Items) use pipes | to separate items in the list.
For example

>>  HYPERPOTION|HYPERPOTION|POTION
>>  20|20|0|20|0|32

Anyone is free to use, copy, extend, etc with or without credit.
